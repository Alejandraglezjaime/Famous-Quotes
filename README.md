The program runs while it is operating within the application (using the ID "IntelliJ IDEA"), and to visualize it, the program must be opened on a local server. For this, "Live Server" in Visual Studio Code is used. The data displayed is retrieved from the pgAdmin database, where movies and TV shows along with all their information are stored.

The database contains 20 different records.

*¡IMPORTANT!*: When the program stops compiling, the `index.html` file stops displaying the data retrieved from the database. Therefore, to view the quotes, the program must be compiling each time.
